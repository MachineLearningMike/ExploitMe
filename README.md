# Basic Training Ethereum/Solidity Project

This prject demonstrates 
- re-entry vunerabilities of smart contracs
- re-entry attacks
- re-entry tolerance
- re-entry prevention

# Project requirements

- Explain how someone could deposit more than 1 eth per block, on the ExploitMe0 contract.
- Find a reentrancy vulnerability and send us a sample contract that exploits it.
- Optimise the `receive` function so that it is at least 20% cheaper and send a sample contract showing how the optimisation is done

# Instructions

- Build your own solutions, and do not peek over the Expliotor, ExploitMe1, ExploitMe2 contracts, which are the solutions.
